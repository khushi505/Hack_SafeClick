# What makes us different
1. One of its kind: We use advanced diffusion models for hyper-realistic virtual try-on experiences.
2. Unmatched realism: The fine-tuned diffusion model delivers lifelike images, unlike typical AR/VR methods. [model release date: 4 March 2024]
3. Seamless process: Users upload a photo and garment images for instant visualization with realism.
4. Exceptional Feature: We let users visualize their imagination of clothing with one click in the same place.
5. The Next Application in the Fashion Industry: We believe that the diffusion models are very soon going to overtake the AR/VR techniques for virtual try-ons in the e-commerce stores.
